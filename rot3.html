<h1> Project Description: <h1>
<br>
<h1> The first project of this cycle was making a T-shirt using photoshop. I became more familiar with photoshop and found it easy to use. I photoshopped Erin and I onto a waterfall with a Jeep on top, Michael Phelps swimming in the water along with Zac Efron in a boat. I also added a dog and two floaties in the water. This project was very fun because I already knew how to use the T-shirt printer.

<h1> The second project of this rotation was designing and printing a dye sublamation object of our choice, I chose to print on a 30" by 20.5" pillowcase. For my design I photoshopped my two friends and I onto Progressive Field and added some Indians players, a hot air balloon and the Goodyear blimp. This project was very fun to do and the dye sublamation printer was cool and a new machine for me to use.
