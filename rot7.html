<h1>Rotation 7: Lamination and Vacuum Forming <h1>
<br>
<br>
<h1> Project Description: <h1>
<br>
<h1> This rotation, we made skateboards! We starting by picking a regular or longboard, I picked a regular. There were seven pieces of wood that all were glued together with wood glue and then put into a vaccum sealed bag. After that we sanded the edges with sanders and with the wood cutting machine. I then printed out about 55 stickers of things that I like and put them all on my skateboard. I then put a clear gloss coat overtop.
