<h1>Rotation 5: 3D Printing and Scanning <h1>

<h1> The first project of this rotation was to 3D scan our head with the scanning tablet and then putting it into meshmixer and combine it with another object. I combined mine with a pedestal, putting my head on a pedestal. This project was my first time using meshmixer and I found it pretty diffiuclt to figure out.

<h1> The second project of the rotation was to create a useful 3D object. I created a comb using Fusion360. This object is useful because it is portable and I can brush my hair with it. I liked this project of creating something useful.

<h1> For MakerBot Fifth Gen Replicators there are limitations and rules. The maximum fineness of a peak is 1.55 mm, the minimum thickness of a rounded off standing rectangle is 1.2 mm, the minimum width of a cut is .45 mm, the file must be in .stl as .makerbot, the object must be flat on the platform, and the hollow or opening part must be on the top when it prints.
