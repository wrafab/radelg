<h1>Rotation 5: 3D Printing and Scanning <h1>
<br>
<br>
<h1> Project Description: <h1>
<br>
<h1> The first project of this rotation was to 3D scan our head with the scanning tablet and then putting it into meshmixer and combine it with another object. I combined mine with a pedestal, putting my head on a pedestal. This project was my first time using meshmixer and I found it pretty diffiuclt to figure out.
