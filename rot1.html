<h1> Project Description: <h1>
<br>
<h1> For our first project, we designed a wax stamp. I built my stamp on Fusion360, a new program to me. I first started out by watching videos on how to make a stamp, but I eventually went with my own idea for the design. I started off by makning a horizontal cylinder and then extruded it. Next I created a vertical cylinder on top of the horizontal cylinder and then extruded it. After both were extruded, I champfered both of them. The most difficult part was trying to get each curve of the whale to be the same angled arc. This took me many attempts but I finally figured it out. I found it pretty difficult to use at first but then I began to get used to it. I designed my stamp as a whale. My first stamp attempt did not work out because my stamp was way too large (three inches), so then I reprinted it at 40% of the original size.
