<h1> Project Description: <h1>
<br>
<h1> For our first project, we designed a wax stamp. I built my stamp on Fusion360, a new program to me. I first started out by watching videos on how to make a stamp, but I eventually went with my own idea for the design. I found it pretty difficult to use at first but then I began to get used to it. I designed my stamp as a whale.
