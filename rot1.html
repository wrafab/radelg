<h1> Project Description: <h1>
<br>
<h1> For our first project, we designed a wax stamp. I built my stamp on Fusion360, a new program to me. I first started out by watching videos on how to make a stamp, but I eventually went with my own idea for the design. The most difficult part was trying to get each curve of the whale to be the same angled arc. This took me many attempts but I finally figured it out. I found it pretty difficult to use at first but then I began to get used to it. I designed my stamp as a whale.
