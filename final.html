<h1> Project Description: <h1>
<br>
<h1> After pondering for many days, almost a week on what to make for my final project, I chose to make a game board box. I got this idea from my friend's little sister who I love to play board games with. I started out by designing a box on CorelDraw that was 13 inches wide by 8 inches high. I then lazer cut this box out on the lazer cutter. I next decided that for the first side I would make a checker board. I also designed this on CorelDraw and lazer cut it onto one side of the board. I then went on Fusion360 to design checkers pieces that I then 3D print on the maker bot 3D printer. I then spray painted the pieces black and red. For the other bottom side of the board, I decided to make one of my all time favorite games, sorry! I designed a sticker on CorelDraw and printed it out on the Roland Versaworks sticker printer. I then decided to also 3D print the sorry pieces after designing them on Fusion360. For the next side of my board, I decided to make a velcrow version of tic tac toe. I made the board out of vinyl stickers and designed ovals for the pieces. I lazer cut the pieces and fursnished half of them so that they would be two different types of wood. For the last side of the box, I decided to make a mini version of Scrabble. I started by lazer cutting squares to be the letters and wrote the alphabet letters with a sharpie. I made the board out of vinyl stickers. For the inside of my box, I made on side with a hot glued on handle to open it. On the inside I cut out squares and made boxes to store all of the pieces in. This project was really fun to make and I will definetely use it in the future.
