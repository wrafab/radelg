<h1>Rotation 10: Raspberry Pi <h1>
<br>
<br>
<h1> Project Description: <h1>
<br>
<h1> This rotation, we did Rasberry Pi. This was another electronic circut with a bread board and Rasberry Pi but this was more of electronic computing. I found this process more fun than the other ones because of the computer porgrams. Programs like sketch and python are important because they translate the code of the computer into the code of the Rasberry Pi. My favorite porject was coding the Sense Hat into colors and patterns we wanted. I made it scroll my name, made a smiley face, and a checker board. We also made it blink on and off in colors we wanted. I found this specfic process very fun and creative. I also liked the camera because I love taking pictures but unfortunately I missed most of the camera stuff.
