<h1> Project Description: <h1>
<br>
<h1> The first project of this cycle was to create a laser cut box with both rastering and engraving. I made my box in corel draw a three by three inch box on cardboard. This project was my second time using the laser cutter.

<h1> The third project of this cycle was desiging and laser printing on anything we wanted. I chose a glass. I made two glasses, both with images from google on corel. The dolphin cup turned out better than the pineapple cup because it was a clearer image.
