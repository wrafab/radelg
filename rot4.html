<h1>Rotation 4: Laser Cutting and Engraving and Vinyl Cutting <h1>
<br>
<br>
<h1> Project Description: <h1>
<br>
<h1> The first project of this cycle was to create a laser cut box with both rastering and engraving. I made my box in corel draw a three by three inch box on cardboard. I put my name and heart on one side, Jason Kipnis on another, Snapchat, a sloth. a softball, and the state of Ohio. This project was my second time using the laser cutter.

<h1> The second project of this cycle was designing three different shapes that when laser printed will connect together. This project I also designed in Corel Draw. I made the shapes by creating a shape on corel then making a hairline rectangle that was the same on each shape that would cut out to connect them. This idea worked well.

<h1> The third project of this cycle was desiging and laser printing on anything we wanted. I chose a glass. I made two glasses, both with images from google on corel. The dolphin cup turned out better than the pineapple cup because it was a clearer image. I learned after the first try with the pineapple that using a clip art image with no background came out very clear and not pixely.
