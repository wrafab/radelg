<h1>Rotation 9: Arduino <h1>

<h1> Project Description: <h1>
<br>
<h1> For the Arduino, we used a bread board attached to an arduino uno. At first, I found the pictures in the book hard to follow but eventually it became easier to read them. In order to make circuts, you had to connect the wires to both the power source on the arduino itself and the bread board positive and negative. This process was very fun to learn and it was my favorite electronic we did. For Arduino, we had to create our own code. I did ine by adding six more LED's than the original code had and I found it interesting seeing how the power works for each LED and how to get power into each one.
