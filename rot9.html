<h1>Rotation 9: Arduino <h1>

<h1> Project Description: <h1>
<br>
<h1> For the Arduino, we used a bread board attached to an arduino uno. In order to make circuts, you had to connect the wires to both the power source on the arduino itself and the bread board positive and negative. This process was very fun to learn and it was my favorite electronic we did.
